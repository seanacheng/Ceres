# Ceres
Expedition Ceres is a native iOS game where you have to collect precious gems as they are mined out of a mineral-rich asteroid. As the mining mission progresses, the gems are produced at a more rapid rate and they become increasingly more radioactively unstable. Collect gems for as long you can. However, pay careful attention to gems that are flying off screen; each one will deplete your gem count and bring you one step closer to mission failure.

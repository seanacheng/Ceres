# Ceres
Expedition Ceres is a native iOS game where you have to collect precious gems as they are mined out a mineral-rich asteroid. As the mining mission progresses the gems are produced at a more rapid rate and they become increasingly more radioactively unstable. Collect gems for as long you can. However, pay careful attention to gems that are flying off screen, each one will deplete your gem count and bring you one step closer to mission failure.
